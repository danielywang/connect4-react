#### About
This game is a react.js demo for my final project in AP Computer Science A. I had a blast learning react and making this game!

#### Instructions

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App]("https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app").
To run the game on your local machine, run `npm start` and go to `localhost:3000`
Edit `index` files in `src` to customize the game.
