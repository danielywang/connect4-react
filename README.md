### About
This game is a react.js demo for my AP Computer Science A class. I had a blast learning react and sharing it with the class!

### Instructions
The game is live at https://dw-apcs-connect4.web.app

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)
